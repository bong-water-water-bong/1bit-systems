# Why no Python at runtime? (Rule A)

**One-line answer**: Python is fine as a caller or a build-time tool. It's banned inside any systemd service, any HTTP endpoint, any hot-path process. We've been burned too many times by dependency hell, silent import failures, and 300 MB interpreter images shipped to run a 4 GB model.

## Scope

**Banned at runtime**: anything that's the target of a systemd unit, anything serving an HTTP request, anything on the startup path of the stack.

**Allowed elsewhere**:
- Caller-side scripts — DSPy, lemonade-python-sdk, user's jupyter notebook.
- Build-time tooling — our `.h1b` requantizer runs once to convert Microsoft's weights. It's a Python + PyTorch one-shot that writes a file. Not shipped.
- Research notebooks — benchmark analysis, paper reproduction. Output is numbers or plots, not services.

## What we tried first

Gen-1 of 1bit systems was Python (AMD Lemonade + transformers + a custom FastAPI layer). It was the natural starting point — Microsoft's reference is Python, MLX is Python, lemonade is Python, every BitNet community project is Python.

What we hit:

1. **Cold-start latency** — 4-12 seconds to import torch + transformers + numpy before the first inference. On a service meant to serve LAN requests, that's a restart outage. Rust `1bit-server` cold-start is ~200 ms.
2. **Dependency churn** — `pip install` resolvers pick different versions day to day. One morning the Lemonade server wouldn't start because a transitive dep bumped past a compatible minor. Rust cargo's lockfile prevents this class of bug.
3. **Silent failure modes** — Python typing is advisory. JSON parsing fails at the first bad field, which may be six levels deep in an error the user sees as a 500. Rust serde fails at deserialization with a precise path.
4. **Multiple Pythons** — the dev box had `python3.12`, the install script pulled `python3.11`, the AUR package expected `python3.13`. Three stacks. Three venv roots. Three reasons the service won't start on a fresh box.
5. **Binary size** — the gen-1 install weighed 1.2 GB of Python + wheels. Gen-2 Rust is 15 MB of static-ish binaries.
6. **Global interpreter lock** — Python's concurrency story is either subprocess (slow) or asyncio (complicated, doesn't parallelize CPU-bound code). Rust `tokio` handles 1000+ concurrent HTTP connections on one thread.

## The immediate wins of the Rust rewrite

- Install time: `./install-strixhalo.sh` is 5 minutes end-to-end, most of it spent compiling kernels.
- First-request latency: under 250 ms cold, effectively 0 warm.
- Memory footprint at idle: ~80 MB for 1bit-server vs ~350 MB for the gen-1 Python process.
- Error messages: deserializer-level "expected u32 at `.usage.prompt_tokens`, got string" vs Python's "`KeyError: 'usage'`" with no line number.

## But what about speed of development?

Genuinely, Python's write-time is faster. We accept ~1.5× the implementation time in exchange for ~10× the deploy reliability. For a stack that's going to run unattended in a closet for months, the trade favors Rust.

## "What about the kernels?"

Kernels are C++. Rule B, not Rule A. C++ at the kernel layer is specifically blessed because:
- The GPU compiler toolchain is C++.
- The surface is small (30 extern "C" functions).
- The FFI boundary with Rust is tight and reviewed.

## "What about the Python requantizer?"

Build-time, not runtime. `requantize-h1b.py` reads Microsoft's `.safetensors`, writes our `.h1b` format, exits. Runs once per model release. Never shipped with the binary, never called by a service.

If we ever needed a *runtime* requantize (which we don't — the output is cached to disk), we'd port to Rust before running it under a systemd unit.

## Enforcement

- `halo-install-strixhalo.sh` checks for any stray `python` in systemd unit `ExecStart` lines and warns.
- `halo doctor` flags any Python process consuming >100 MB on the box at runtime.
- The 1bit-mcp MCP server is Rust; the DSPy / Claude Code plugin examples are Python — that's a caller, not a service.
