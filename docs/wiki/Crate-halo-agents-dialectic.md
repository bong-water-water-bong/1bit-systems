# Crate: halo-agents / dialectic

**Phase:** analysis  
**Status:** scaffold landed 2026-04-20, LLM derivation pass TODO  
**Upstream reference:** [plastic-labs/honcho][honcho] (MIT, Python + Postgres)

Rust reimplementation of Honcho's dialectic user-modeling surface as a
module in `halo-agents`. No Python FFI, no Postgres — SQLite via the
`rusqlite` (`bundled`) dep we already pull in for `sessions`.

## What is dialectic user modeling

For every incoming **Observation** (a labelled chunk of a peer's utterance
inside a session), a dialectic pipeline derives structured **Inferences** —
claims about the peer — citing the observations that support them. Claims
are accumulated across sessions keyed by `(observer_peer, observed_peer)`,
so peer A's model of peer B is distinct from peer B's self-model. On
query, claims tagged against the observed peer are filtered by relevance
and returned ranked. Honcho's production pipeline uses an LLM to distill
raw messages into claims ("derivation task") and a second LLM call at
query time ("dialectic chat") to synthesize an answer over the top; the
Rust port stubs both today (ingestion stores the observation verbatim as
a claim, query is case-insensitive keyword overlap) and leaves the LLM
call as a clearly marked `TODO`.

## Rust surface

```
crates/halo-agents/src/dialectic/
    mod.rs        — public types + observe() / infer() functions + tests
    store.rs      — DialecticStore trait + SqliteDialecticStore impl + DDL
```

Re-exports live at `halo_agents::{UserModel, Observation, Inference,
ObservationKind, DialecticStore, SqliteDialecticStore, observe, infer}`.

## SQL schema (SQLite, halo-agents/dialectic)

```sql
CREATE TABLE dialectic_observations (
    id          INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    session_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
    peer_id     TEXT NOT NULL,
    text        TEXT NOT NULL,
    timestamp   INTEGER NOT NULL,
    kind        TEXT NOT NULL           -- 'explicit' | 'derived'
);

CREATE TABLE dialectic_inferences (
    id           INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    observer_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
    observed_id  TEXT NOT NULL,
    claim        TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at   INTEGER NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX idx_dinf_pair
    ON dialectic_inferences(observer_id, observed_id, created_at DESC);

CREATE TABLE dialectic_supports (
    inference_id   INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES dialectic_inferences(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    observation_id INTEGER NOT NULL REFERENCES dialectic_observations(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    PRIMARY KEY (inference_id, observation_id)
);
```

DB lives at `~/.halo/dialectic.db`. Separate file from `~/.halo/state.db`
so FTS5 session reads don't contend with dialectic writes. Same-file
colocation is safe — object names are prefixed `dialectic_`.

## Deviation from Honcho upstream

| Honcho upstream                              | halo-agents/dialectic                          | Reason                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Postgres + pgvector + HNSW                   | SQLite (rusqlite bundled)                      | Zero-dep beyond what `sessions` already pulls; Rule A (no Python) holds. |
| `Workspace` multi-tenant                     | Single-tenant (dropped)                        | One operator, one box; revisit if halo-server ever hosts 3rd parties.  |
| `Peer` row with config/metadata              | Peer referenced by string id                   | Peer registry is `halo-agents::sessions::sessions.user_id`; no need to dup. |
| `Messages` at session scope                  | `dialectic_observations`                       | Separation lets FTS5 session search keep its own row layout.           |
| LLM "derivation task" distills claims        | Scaffold: claim := observation text verbatim   | Prompt templates + hooks land after routing is wired end-to-end.       |
| LLM "dialectic chat" synthesizes answers     | Case-insensitive keyword overlap ranker        | Drop-in ranker swap once the specialist prompt lands (Librarian).       |
| pgvector cosine similarity over embeddings   | (deferred)                                     | Wait for halo-core embedder; keyword ranker is fine for the scaffold.   |
| `Document.level` (explicit / derived / …)    | `ObservationKind::{Explicit, Derived}`         | Enum present, only `Explicit` produced today. `Derived` reserved for LLM pass. |
| Async task queue (`queue`, `dream`, reconciler) | — (not in scaffold)                         | Derivation is synchronous today. Revisit when LLM pass lands.          |
| Webhooks                                     | —                                              | Not needed for local single-operator deploy.                           |
| Collections of vector-embedded documents (RAG) | —                                            | `halo-agents::memory` + `sessions` FTS5 cover our RAG story today.     |

## Top-level API (Rust)

```rust
use halo_agents::{observe, infer, Observation, ObservationKind, SqliteDialecticStore};

let store = SqliteDialecticStore::open_default()?;       // ~/.halo/dialectic.db
let obs = Observation {
    session_id: "cli-2026-04-20".into(),
    peer_id:    "bob".into(),
    text:       "bob prefers terse CLI output".into(),
    timestamp:  now_unix(),
    kind:       ObservationKind::Explicit,
};
observe(&store, "alice", obs)?;                          // writes + derives
let claims = infer(&store, "alice", "bob", "CLI style")?; // ranked recall
```

## Endpoints we'd need to mirror (future; not wired today)

Reference list for when we expose this to halo-mcp / halo-server:

- `POST /dialectic/observe` → `observe()`
- `GET  /dialectic/infer?observer=&observed=&q=` → `infer()`
- `GET  /dialectic/user_model/{observer}/{observed}` → `list_inferences()`
- `GET  /dialectic/observation/{id}` → `get_observation()`

Route shape mirrors Honcho's `POST /peers/{peer_id}/chat` + `GET
/peers/.../representation` but scoped at the `(observer, observed)`
pair level, which maps more cleanly to our multi-agent specialist mesh
than Honcho's implicit "assistant = current user" assumption.

## Tests

Five in-crate unit tests under `dialectic::tests`:

1. `empty_store_infer_returns_empty` — fresh store, no panic.
2. `two_observations_same_topic_both_cited` — ranking + citation.
3. `observations_do_not_cross_contaminate_peers` — observed-peer scoping.
4. `observers_do_not_cross_contaminate` — observer-peer scoping.
5. `empty_query_returns_all_newest_first` — default full-representation.

Total crate tests after port: **67 unit + 1 integration** (was 62 + 1).

## Open work (in order)

1. **LLM derivation task.** Replace the verbatim-claim scaffold in
   `observe()` with a prompt-backed distillation step. Target specialist:
   `Librarian` (it already owns memory synthesis).
2. **Embedding-based ranker.** Swap keyword overlap for cosine similarity
   once `halo-core` ships an embedder. DDL already reserves the `claim`
   column layout; only `list_inferences` query changes.
3. **halo-mcp surface.** Expose the four endpoints above through the MCP
   bridge.
4. **halo-server HTTP surface.** Route to `/v1/dialectic/*` behind the
   same bearer guard the rest of halo-server uses.
